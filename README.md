# Work-Simulator-2089

Have you had the unfortunate burden of alwyas finding work fulfilling and satisfying, and wonder how life is for those privileged masses who don't?

Did you watch Severance and think "Wow, macrodata refinement looks like the job for me!" and wanted a taste of that sweet, sweet action?

Like most people in the world, have you ever found yourself thinking "being able to read and understand the undeciphered script of the ancient Minoans known as Linear A is my number one goal in life?"

If so, have I got the experience for you.

It won't help you understand Linear A, but it might inadvertantly teach you its characters.
